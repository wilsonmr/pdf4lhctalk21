  Not a critical setting for this kind of study.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Typically we see PDFs bending and/or other datasets being poorly
    fitted.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rule of thumb: Have the dataset contributed roughly as much to the
  total error function as all the of the data (assuming
  \(\chi^2\)/ndat=1) \[
  w = \text{total ndat}/\text{dataset ndat}
  \] e.g.~DO e ASY has 11 points and we have 4524 in total, so we set a
  weight of 411.
