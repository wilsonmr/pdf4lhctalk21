# NNPDF talk for PDF4LHC

## Notes
 - Before your section set author name for your slides with
 `\author[<your name>]{}`
 - Add a subsection for your slides for the headline
 - Can also change institution before your slide
 - Current "style" is very much a hacked together thing to look like JCM's slides
 in particular setting date as PDF4LHC so it appears in footer - we should fix
 this (if possible).
